                <p>Nestled between Baltimore and Washington, DC in PG (Prince George’s) County, Maryland shaped life for artist 
                Baronhawk Poitier. Spending the bulk of his youth sorting through records and other music memorabilia at The 
                Record Exchange in Silver Spring, Maryland, exposed him to decades of music which heavily influenced his pursuit 
                of a career in DJing and production. As a solo artist, he's played before Nicky Siano, Grandmaster Flash, Slick 
                Rick, DJ Spinna, Dubtribe Soundsystem, Metro Area, Disclosure, Claude Vonstroke, Oscar G, Chromeo, Karizma/ 
                Kaytronik and local DC legend Sam “The Man” Burns. The DMC DJ competition and turntablist event has featured 
                him during several of the DC regional battles as one of their party-rocking favs. Poitier was recognized 
                alongside mentor and teacher Kris Klayton aka Karizma/ Kaytronik with a grant from the Maryland Historic Trust 
                and the Maryland State Arts Council in 2015. Together they presented a Baltimore style of dance music production 
                to the entire community through a showcase at the Maryland Folklife Festival and the release of his first EP 
                under the direction of Karizma for R2 Records. His passion for cultural preservation and artist recognition 
                began while working under Junious “House” Brickhouse as a Artistic Directors and Sound Designers for the 501(c)3 
                non-profit organization Urban Artistry Inc., an International Culture and Education Project founded in 2005. 
                Serving as a steward for urban dance and music culture globally presented him opportunities to headline battles 
                and dance competitions such as: "The International Soul Society Festival" (USA), “Jam On It” (Bulgaria), "Who 
                Can Roast The Most" (USA), "Clash CPH" (Denmark) and the USA qualifier for the "Flow Mo Anniversary (FINLAND)."</p>
                <p>Within the LGBTQ dance music community he has earned a name for himself as a member of The NeedlExchange, 
                a DC based, queer DJ collective with partners Bil Todd & Tommy Cornelis. Baronhawk plays an integral role building 
                a resume for the artist group coordinating and playing events such as; Hot Mass (Honcho, Pittsburgh), Fag Bash 
                (P Town) and opening sets for TNXDC showcases featuring The Honey Soundsystem, Sleazy McQueen, Gay Marvine, DJ 
                Harvey, Horse Meat Disco, Kim Ann Foxman and Honey Dijon. Collectively by working through TNX and Urban Artistry, 
                Baronhawk Poitier continues his passion for igniting dance floors into a frenzy while educating fans about 
                cypher etiquette and culture.</p>
